# CS/COE 1530 - Software Engineering
Fall Semester 2016

## DUE DATE: 29 SEP 2016

## Deliverable 1

For the first sprint, each group will need to:

1. Determine initial user stories for the project, including prioritization
2. Write a walking skeleton of the application using gradle, which should include at least one unit test and a "Hello, world!" style main method
3. Determine a test plan and branching/integration plan
4. Make a "paper prototype" of the user interface

The team should determine the Scrum Master for this first sprint.  The Scrum Master will change each sprint.

## Format

For the first sprint, you will turn in:

1. A cover page, in the format described below
2. A backlog of user stories, ranked by prioritization (highest priority first)
3. A "walking skeleton" application available on GitHub or GitLab (ADD ME AS A COLLABORATOR!  Username on either site is "laboon")
3. A description of your test plan and branching plan
4. A description of how you determined the user stories, how you prioritized them, and other decisions made in the sprint (see below)
5. A paper prototype (drawing) of the system, and a general description of how users will interact with the system

Each of these sections shall be CLEARLY MARKED (i.e. they should each have titles and start on their own page).

Format for cover page:
* The names of the people in the group.  Mark down who the Scrum Master is this sprint, e.g. "Jane Doe (Scrum Master)"
* The date that it is due (29 SEPTEMBER 2016)
* The title "CS 1530 - SPRINT 1 DELIVERABLE"

## Grading
* User Stories and Ranking: 35% of grade
* Walking Skeleton: 15% of grade
* Paper prototype: 25% of grade
* Test and Branching/Integration Plan: 10% of grade
* Decision Descriptions: 15% of grade

User stories shall be in the Connextra template ("As a.. I want.. so that..") and provide good, user-level descriptions of user needs and wants.  User stories should be printed in order of priority.  It is NOT expected that you will complete every single user story, or even that these are the final versions of the user story; they may change and be prioritized differently as the sprints go on.

User stories should flow from the needs of the customer.  Your discussions with the customer should guide the user stories themselves as well as their prioritization.

The number of user stories will vary based on the project, but it should be at least eight at the VERY minimum.  If there are fewer than eight stories, the project may be too small or your user stories too big.

The walking skeleton __must__ compile and show some minimal output (this can be as simple as a debug statement, "Hello, World!" on the console, etc.)  It should follow the general outline of a walking skeleton as discussed in GOOSGBT.  You can have more, but it is essential that your program compiles and runs without error!

The walking skeleton __must__ be able to run on __everybody's__ computer!  Everybody should have access to the repository on GitHub and able to make commits by the end of this sprint.

The test plan should be at least several paragraphs explaining what sorts of things you think will need to be tested, and why.  Remember to include functional and non-functional aspects (reliability, scalability, performance, etc)!

The branching/integration plan should detail how branches will be named and how they will be integrated.  You have several possibilities: allow anyone to integrate a branch to master after somebody else reviews it, have only the Scrum Master or other person be in charge of it, have anybody BESIDES the original writer merge branches, etc.  I will NOT accept any plan which does not require somebody else to look at the code before merging it to master!  Code shall be reviewed!

Keep in mind that neither the test plan nor integration plan are written in stone.  You may modify them as the sprints go on if you feel they are not meeting your needs.  But I want you to think about them now in the "setup" sprint.

The description of decisions should be, at an absolute minimum, one page of text.  It should include any background research you did on the domain, your interactions with the customer, and your team's opinions on prioritization.  Be sure to include any __disagreement__ your team had internally!  Software engineering is rarely without some sort of disagreement about the direction of the software. 

The description of decisions should also indicate what you think is effective and ineffective during this sprint, and what you plan to do about these going forward.  For example, stand-ups took up too much time so we're shortening them, people were stepping over each other's code so the team is going to use a different branching model, etc.  This concept of continuous improvement is important to the Scrum methodology.

Yes, grammar and spelling count.  Points will be deducted for more than one grammatical or spelling error per section.
